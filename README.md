# Bad-Apple-On-RaspberryPi5+SSD1306
## a project for playing bad apple on rpi5 with ssd1306 0.96inch oled

- You can play bad apple on a raspberry pi 5 NOW!

- I found some old project that they only can use old rpi or old system, no one makes a new version of that, so i made this one

-  I will upload **How  To Use This Proj To Play BA** and **How To Play Another Video By This Proj** on README soon (a few days)

- If you need to contact with me: [my bilibili account]('https://b23.tv/GNuXiFn') and 
[my blog]('https://xtiantech.cn')

### You can upload some issue for me. I will try my best to fix those,thanks a lot!
